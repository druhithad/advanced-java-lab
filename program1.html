1.	Difference between core java  and advanced  java
Core java:
It forms the foundation of java.it includes basic syntax,libraries.
It covers essential programming constructs such as variables,data types,operators,control statements.
It is an object oriented programming language(OOPS) it has key principles like polymorphism,encapsulation
It has error handling  in runtime
It supports multithreading which helps users to develop applications
Advanced java:
It  connects the programming language to the database  it allows languages like sql  to run
It supports servlets which develops the web applications
It includes security features like jaas
It provides advanced networking capabilities like socket programming
2.	what are the main features of Applets in java
It is once a very popular web application,it was a small program written in java and ran inside a web browser,its package name is java.applet	
Features:
It is platform independent
It provides security
It provides  GUI
Facilitates graphics and animations
Enables event handling
3.	what are the key features of  servlets
Using Servlets, we can collect input from users through web page forms, present records from a database or another source, and create web pages dynamically. Some important features of servlet are
More secure than normal java code
Portability
robust, 
secure
 servlet code have better performance 
  4.  What are the differences between Applets and Servlets in Java?
Applets:
A Java applet is a small application which is written in Java and delivered to users in the form of bytecode.
Applets are executed on client side.
Applets are used to provide interactive features to web applications that cannot be provided by HTML alone like capture mouse input etc.
Servlets
A servlet is a Java programming language class used to extend the capabilities of a server.
Servlets are executed on server side.
Servlets are the Java counterpart to other dynamic Web content technologies such as PHP and ASP.NET.
5. What are the major features of Java compared to other programming languages?
Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.
 
Java is fast, reliable, and secure. From desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet, Java is used in every nook and corner. 

Here, we are comparing 3 other languages (Python, C++,and C) with Java. 
•	Platform Independence:
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This eliminates the need to recompile code for different operating systems or hardware architectures. 
•	Object-Oriented Programming:
Java is a fully object-oriented language, meaning it utilizes concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure code in a modular and reusable way. 
•	Robustness:
Java has strong features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), exception handling, and type checking, which help in building reliable and stable applications. 
•	Security:
Java provides built-in security features, such as a security manager and bytecode verifier, that help prevent security breaches and malicious attacks. 
 6.  What is the main role of JDBC and ODBC in database connectivity?
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) are both APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable applications to connect with databases, but they differ in their scope and implementation. JDBC is specifically designed for Java applications to interact with databases, while ODBC provides a more general interface for various programming languages to access different databases. 
JDBC
•	Java-specific:
JDBC is a Java API, meaning it's primarily used for Java applications to communicate with databases. 
•	Database-agnostic:
It provides a standardized way for Java applications to connect to different databases using the same API, regardless of the specific database system. 
•	Four types of drivers:
JDBC drivers are used to connect to different databases, with the most common being Type 4 (thin driver) for direct database access. 
•	Key operations:
JDBC enables common database operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (CRUD) through SQL statements. 
7. Differences between ODBC and JDBC:
•	ODBC is for connecting to databases using C/C++ and supports multiple platforms.
•	JDBC is Java-specific for database connectivity.
•	ODBC uses drivers native to the OS, JDBC uses Java drivers.
•	JDBC is tightly integrated with Java applications.
8. Differences between Cookies and Sessions:
•	Cookies store data on the client-side; sessions store data on the server-side.
•	Cookies have size limits (~4KB); sessions can store more data.
•	Cookies persist after browser closes (if set), sessions expire when browser closes or timeout occurs.
•	Cookies are visible/editable by the user; sessions are more secure as stored server-side.
9. Differences between Spring Boot and Traditional Spring Framework:
•	Spring Boot is opinionated, auto-configures and simplifies setup.
•	Traditional Spring requires manual XML or Java config.
•	Spring Boot has embedded servers, traditional Spring requires external server setup.
•	Spring Boot accelerates development with starter dependencies.
10. Differences between Standalone Applications and Web Applications:
•	Standalone apps run on a single device independently; web apps run on servers and accessed via browsers.
•	Standalone apps don’t need internet; web apps require network connectivity.
•	Web apps are platform-independent; standalone apps may be platform-specific.
11. Basic requirements for executing a web application:
•	Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
•	Application server or runtime environment (e.g., Tomcat, Node.js).
•	Database server (optional, if the app uses a database).
•	Browser to access the app.
